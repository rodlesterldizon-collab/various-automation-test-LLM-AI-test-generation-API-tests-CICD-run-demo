> **Built by Rod Lester Dizon**
>
> This repository is a **portfolio and feature showcase** designed to highlight various test automation capabilities, architectural patterns, and AI-assisted engineering workflows. Rather than functioning as a live, production-deployed infrastructure, it serves as a comprehensive reference portfolio demonstrating multi-layer test automation across UI, API, LLM evaluation, Accessibility, and Performance testing. Public demo targets (SauceDemo, ReqRes, Deque) are used intentionally to provide a stable, observable environment for showcasing these feature implementations.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Patterns

### Page Object Model (POM)

Strict POM enforcement ensures a clean separation of concerns: page objects own UI interactions, spec files own orchestration and assertions. This standard is audited programmatically by the Architecture Agent during the code generation phase.

```
tests/
├── pages/                    # Page objects only — no test logic
│   ├── base.page.ts          # Base page class with shared methods
│   ├── login.page.ts
│   ├── inventory.page.ts
│   └── checkout-*.page.ts    # Specialized per-step pages
├── common/
│   └── component/            # Reusable UI component objects
│       └── navigation-bar.ts
├── helpers/                  # Shared utilities & config
│   └── utils.ts
└── *.spec.ts                 # Test implementations — tests/ root only

specs/                        # Human-readable test specifications (Markdown)
├── login.md
├── checkout-flow.md
└── README.md
```

**Architecture Rules:**

| ✅ DO | ❌ DON'T |
| :--- | :--- |
| Page helpers in `tests/pages/*.ts` | Put test logic inside page objects |
| Tests in `tests/*.spec.ts` | Create spec files in subdirectories |
| Utilities in `tests/helpers/` | Duplicate helper logic across specs |

### Defense-in-Depth Selector Strategy

The framework enforces a resilient locator hierarchy to survive UI changes without manual intervention:

1. **Semantic Locators** — `getByRole`, `getByLabel`, `getByText` (accessibility-first, most resilient)
2. **Engineering Identifiers** — `data-testid` (stable, team-controlled fallback)
3. **Structural Fallbacks** — CSS classes as the final layer, continuously hardened by the Healer Agent

### Visual Regression Detection

A custom `compareVisuals` utility programmatically detects UI discrepancies — such as all product images rendering as the same source — by comparing image buffers and DOM `src` attributes. This catches visual bugs that assertion-only tests miss entirely.

## 🧪 Test Coverage

> [!NOTE]
> This project focuses on high-impact scenarios to demonstrate architectural patterns rather than 100% feature coverage of the demo targets. The patterns demonstrated here transfer directly to enterprise-scale systems.

### UI Tests — SauceDemo

| Scenario | What It Validates |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Multi-Persona Authentication** | Login state across `standard`, `problem`, `performance_glitch`, and `error` user personas |
| **Visual Regression Matrix** | Detects identical product images across personas using buffer comparison |
| **Stateful Checkout Funnel** | Cart state management, shipping data entry, financial total & tax verification |
| **SVG Icon & Error Validation** | Field-level error messages and icon presence for failed authentication flows |

| **Authentication State** | **Inventory Management** | **Stateful Checkout** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| ![Login](screenshots/login.png) | ![Inventory](screenshots/inventory.png) | ![Cart](screenshots/cart.png) |
| Multi-persona login state matrix | Grid state & visual discrepancy detection | Financial total integrity through funnel |

### API Tests — ReqRes

Located in `tests/api/` — 50 API tests demonstrating robust backend validation patterns:

- **Full REST Coverage:** GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE operations with strong TypeScript interfaces
- **Security & Auth Injection:** Dynamic `x-api-key` injection via Playwright config and GitHub Secrets
- **Edge-Case Coverage:** Malformed payloads, non-existent resources, negative pagination values, extreme string lengths, unauthenticated endpoints

> [!NOTE]
> **Free-Tier Sandbox Constraints vs. Enterprise Pipelines:**
> This portfolio relies on shared public sandbox endpoints (ReqRes) and personal free-tier API quotas. In this public demo setting, `HTTP 429` responses are handled gracefully to prevent third-party sandbox rate limits from repeatedly failing public CI runs. In a production enterprise environment with dedicated staging servers, private keys, and SLA contracts, rate limits and skips are classified as infrastructure failures or telemetry exclusions rather than green test states.

### LLM Evaluation — Promptfoo + Groq

Located in `tests/api-llm/` — programmatic evaluation of Large Language Models using Promptfoo.

**Why this matters:** AI features fail silently. Accuracy regressions don't throw exceptions — they return plausible-sounding wrong answers. This suite catches that before production.

**How it works:**
- **Golden Dataset** (`tests/api-llm/golden-dataset.csv`): A curated set of prompts with expected answers used as the ground-truth rubric
- **LLM-as-Judge Grading:** The model grades its own outputs against the golden dataset, creating a fully automated quality gate
- **Custom Provider Adapter** (`tests/api-llm/groqProvider.js`): A hand-engineered JavaScript adapter that bridges Groq's SDK to Promptfoo's evaluation loop — proving the framework's extensibility for unsupported third-party APIs

**Provider Strategy:** Groq (`llama-3.1-8b-instant`) is the default due to its generous free-tier rate limits, which are critical for avoiding `429` errors during CI/CD bulk evaluations. Google Gemini remains in the codebase as a documented fallback.

```bash
# Run LLM evaluation
npm run test:llm:groq

# Setup: add your key to .env
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_key_here
```

**Evaluation Output:**

### Accessibility Audits — Axe-core + Lighthouse

Located in `tests/accessibility/` — a dynamic, multi-engine accessibility scanning module.

**Engineering decisions:**
- **URL-Driven Orchestration:** Takes a `URL_LIST` environment variable instead of hardcoded URLs, generating parallel test suites on the fly for any target
- **Non-Blocking Telemetry:** Violations surface as reports rather than blocking public CI jobs (`continue-on-error: true`), maintaining visibility into accessibility debt without failing public demo runs
- **Dual-Engine Coverage:** Axe-core catches strict WCAG violations; Lighthouse provides complete lab audits across Mobile and Desktop viewports

> [!NOTE]
> **Reporting vs. Release Gates:** In a production deployment pipeline, release policy separates reporting from blocking gates: `Critical` and `Serious` WCAG violations act as blocking PR quality gates, while `Minor` findings report to backlog tracking.

| **Axe-Core Custom Dashboard** | **Lighthouse Mobile/Desktop Audit** |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Axe Core Dashboard](screenshots/axe-core.png) | ![Lighthouse Audit](screenshots/lighthouse.png) |

```bash
npm run test:a11y https://broken-workshop.dequelabs.com/
```

### Performance & Load Testing — JMeter via Taurus

Located in `tests/all-perf/` — a JMeter load-testing suite orchestrated by Taurus operating in a **non-blocking telemetry mode**.

#### Telemetry & Baseline Monitoring Strategy

In this showcase environment, performance tests are configured with `continue-on-error: true` in CI/CD. This runs the load tests as non-blocking telemetry jobs to collect performance metrics (latency distributions, error rates, throughput limits) without breaking public demo workflows when running against shared third-party sandboxes.

During baseline 20-user stress tests, the suite captured two real environment limits:
1. The mock API rate-limited traffic at ~10 RPS, triggering a cascade of `429 Too Many Requests` responses
2. Latency spiked well above the 500ms SLA threshold

Both were logged, analyzed, and rendered in the job summary.

> [!NOTE]
> **Measurement vs. Release Policy:** Production CI/CD architectures separate non-blocking load testing from blocking release gates. Lightweight performance smoke tests (e.g., tight SLA latency gates under 5 users) enforce explicit build-failing thresholds, while high-concurrency stress suites run asynchronously for telemetry and capacity planning.

#### Stats Reference

The screenshot below is a real `stats.csv` output captured from a CI/CD run. Use it as a baseline when interpreting future results:

![Performance Stats](screenshots/stats.png)

#### CI/CD Reporting

When the pipeline runs, the framework automatically:
1. **Parses `stats.csv`** and renders a Markdown table of Users / Avg Latency / Error Rate directly on the GitHub Actions Job Summary — stakeholders see results without downloading anything
2. **Uploads raw artifacts** (`kpi.jtl`, HTML dashboards) as downloadable zip files at the bottom of each Actions run

---

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

The pipeline achieves **~1-minute end-to-end execution** with multi-job orchestration and advanced pipeline controls.

- **Job Dependency Management:** `needs: [api-tests]` ensures API tests pass before UI tests begin — explicit serial execution with no wasted compute
- **Workflow Dispatch Toggles:** Engineers can selectively trigger `api`, `ui`, `llm`, or `all` suites from the GitHub UI, bypassing redundant runs
- **Containerized Execution:** Microsoft's `playwright:jammy` image provides pre-packaged OS dependencies and system runtime parity across CI jobs
- **Environment Parity:** Containerized execution ensures identical contexts across local dev, staging, and CI — no "works on my machine" failures
- **Concurrency Matrix:** Performance tests run against a `[20, 50]` user matrix in parallel, producing separate artifact sets per tier

## 🤖 AI-Augmented Engineering Workflow

This framework was built using a **multi-stage Agentic Workflow powered by Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. This is not AI-assisted copy-pasting — it is a structured engineering lifecycle where human oversight governs every stage.

### The Spec-to-Code Lifecycle

| Stage | Agent | What It Did |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Spec Discovery** | Planner MCP | Scanned SauceDemo and autonomously generated `specs/login.md` and `specs/checkout-flow.md` |
| **2. Scaffolding** | Generator MCP | Transformed markdown specs into initial TypeScript test implementations and Page Objects |
| **3. Human Review** | *(Senior SDET oversight)* | Manual correction of logic errors, edge cases, and spec gaps the generator missed |
| **4. POM Enforcement** | Architecture Agent | Audited and refactored the codebase to enforce strict Page Object Model separation |
| **5. Selector Hardening** | Healer MCP | Refactored selectors to the resilient locator hierarchy; established the re-engagement loop for future CI failures |

### Triggering the Agents

```text
@playwright-test-planner      "Create a test plan for the inventory sorting flow"
@playwright-test-generator    "Implement the tests defined in specs/inventory.md"
@playwright-test-architecture "Check if my new page object follows the POM rules"
```

### Self-Healing CI

The **Playwright Test Healer** is designed to close the failure → fix loop automatically:

1. A test fails in CI (e.g. a selector broke due to a UI change)
2. The Healer agent analyzes the failure logs and DOM snapshot
3. The agent generates a corrected selector, re-runs the test, and **auto-commits the fix**

> [!TIP]
> **To enable:** Uncomment the "Install Copilot CLI" and "Run Playwright Test Healer" steps in `.github/workflows/playwright.yml`. Requires a `COPILOT_PAT` repository secret.
